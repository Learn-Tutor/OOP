Object Oriented Programming refers to the concept of buildong software around data (or objects), as opposed to say, functions or logic.
It was coined by Alan Kay, and has since grown in popularity and ease.

Objects can be considered as real life items, like a person, a vehicle, a book etc.

Objects are entities with attributes and methods.
For example, a person can have { name, age, occupation } attributes, and (listens_to_music, reads_books) methods.

Methods are functions relative to an object or a class.

A class can be considered as an "interface" for similarly designed objects.

For example, car can be a class with attributes like, { model, color, year_of_manufacture }, and Toyota is an object within Car class with attributes inherited from thr parent class, and values such as { "Toyota", "gray", "2023" } etc.

There are several concepts in O.O.P including:

- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Message Passing

Among others.

We'll look deeper into this later.
